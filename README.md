### Hi there 👋

## I'm ✨ Ava ✨ a software engineer from London, UK.

##### I come from a pure creative background but I've always loved technology. Throughout my life, I have had success in many creative areas such as music and writing, and they are skills that I still continue to work on to this day. Over the past few years, since my graduation, to make ends meet, I taught English to foreign speakers online (I love languages, and speak 4!). However, one day I woke up, and decided I wanted to make a change in the direction of my life, and aim for something higher. Something more challenging. And thus my journey into tech began...

### 🎮 My ideal future in tech looks like...
My first <strong>goal</strong> is to break into a junior position where I can improve my coding skills and confidence as a programmer. I want to improve and practice my skills and learn new technologies and skills on the way. One day, I would also like to learn more about <strong>UX design</strong> as designing is one of my natural strengths and I enjoy working with markup and styling languages such as HTML5 and CSS, and would love to combine my growing skills and knowledge in software engineering with a more design-based role. I would also like to learn more about other areas of <strong>computer science</strong> such as cryptography, blockchains, machine learning, robotics, AI and so on. Working in the gaming industry as a writer or creative director would be another dream of mine in tech!
